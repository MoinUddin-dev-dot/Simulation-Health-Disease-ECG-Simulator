Heart Disease ECG Simulation Model

Project Overview

This repository contains the Heart Disease ECG Simulation Model, developed as both an iOS SwiftUI application and a web application to simulate patient flow and ECG diagnostics in a hospital setting.


1. iOS SwiftUI Application

Tech Stack:

Language: Swift

Framework: SwiftUI

Visualization: Swift Charts

Features:

Patient arrival simulation with ECG diagnosis.

Multi-server queue model for ECG processing.

Time tracking for patient processing.

Visualization of patient flow using Swift Charts.


Installation & Running the App

Open the project in Xcode (latest version recommended).

Ensure iOS Simulator is selected.

Run the app using Cmd + R.



Challenges & Solutions:

Performance Optimization: Used Combine framework for real-time UI updates.

Data Storage: Implemented Core Data for efficient record management.

State Management: Optimized SwiftUI views for smooth performance.
